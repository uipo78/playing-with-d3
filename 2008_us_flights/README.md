## Summary
index.html displays by month the median delay of each airport in the US.

## Getting started
Every relevant data file is included in the folder data except for the main source. Thus, you must obtain
the relevant data and distill it. The task is actually quite simple:

1. Open the link provided below and download any year's data set by clicking on the year.
2. Save the downloaded file as 'data.csv' in the folder source_data
3. Run make_relevant_data_files.py. 

## Data source
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

Note that the dataset is not included in the source_data folder as it is too big.
